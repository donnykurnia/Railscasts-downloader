This small script will download all RailsCasts episodes from latest episodes to episode 1, skipping any existing episodes in current directory where the script is called.

If you have a paid subscription Pro account, you can find your token, and set it in the script, 
so that all PRO casts are downloaded as well. See comments in railscasts-downloader.rb for more info

## How to use:

    chmod +x railscasts-downloader.rb
    ./railscasts-downloader.rb

## Required gem:

    nokogiri
